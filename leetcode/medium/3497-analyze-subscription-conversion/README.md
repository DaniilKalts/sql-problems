A subscription service wants to analyze user behavior patterns. The company offers a 7-day free trial, after which users can subscribe to a paid plan or cancel. Write a solution to:

- Find users who converted from free trial to paid subscription
- Calculate each user's average daily activity duration during their free trial period (rounded to 2 decimal places)
- Calculate each user's average daily activity duration during their paid subscription period (rounded to 2 decimal places)

Return the result table ordered by user_id in ascending order.
